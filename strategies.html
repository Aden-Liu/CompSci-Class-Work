    <h2>Syngergies</h2>
    <p>Important: Just because a card synergizes well with Mortar, that doesn't mean it should be in every deck. Likewise, just because a card doesn't synergize well with Mortar, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't use it. The meta is always changing; it doesn't matter how well a card synergizes with Mortar if the card itself is bad. This is simply to give you an idea of how you should build your deck.</p>
